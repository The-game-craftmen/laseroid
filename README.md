Laseroid is a multiplayer is a space dog fight game.

A player will launch the game as a host. Other player will join this game.
The game takes place in space. 
The game will support physics, but for fun, some tricks are present to simulate friction, ability to rotate on any axes (even without engine on the wing)...

On v1, players will fight on empty space, without any AI. The gamemode will be a deathmatch, with infinite respawn.
Spaceship will have only frontal laser.
Spaceships can collide with physics.


V2 will fill the scene, to add object to hide behind, and to collide.
